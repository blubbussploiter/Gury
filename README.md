# Gury3d
Roblox 2006 recreation
Built for windows, although with some tinkering (should) work for basically any OS with opengl support

# The final project

I finally learned the git feature for visual studio :) (edit this is a new repository)
Expect more source code commits

# What is Gury3d?
Gury3d is a 2006 roblox studio / client recreation, including lua, graphics and physics! (Just like the 2006 client!)
