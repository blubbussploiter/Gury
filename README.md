# Gury3D
Roblox 2006 recreation

# The Final Project

I finally learned the git feature for visual studio :) (edit this is a new repository)
Expect more source code commits

# What is Gury3D?
Gury3D is a 2006 roblox studio / client recreation which includes lua, graphics, physics and more! (Just like the 2006 client!)
